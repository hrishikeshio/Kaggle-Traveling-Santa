README for Traveling Santa Solution
by Hrishikesh Huilgolkar

The code provided is used to solve traveling santa problem. The code can be used to solve any TSP problem where 2 disjoint paths are to be found.

The input file should be in format of coordinates.

1 11 22
2 93 32
3 44 92
etc

Required python libraries:
numpy, scipy
LKH binary is also required
The following scripts have to be run in the given order to get a solution.
These are in /tools dir.
00_cutter.py 	#Cuts the file in manageable chunks
01_scidist.py	#Creates distance matrix
02_runLKH.py	#runs LKH
03_joiner.py	#joins resulting solution files

5050.py is mingle script which is used to find average of two paths so as to find most optimal solution in our case.
